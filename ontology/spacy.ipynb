            "[Director, Architecture Division] Sustainable IS knowledge utilisation in the department focused on knowledge re-use.\n",

            "[Director, Architecture Division]\n",
            "Sustainable IS utilisation also focused on refining and extending existing routines and competencies from a continual service improvement perspective.\n",

            "Nevertheless, interactions with vendors are not always undertaken with environmental sustainability as the main focus, but rather, sustainability is addressed on a need by need basis as part of wider discussions:\n",

            " \n",
            "START_PARAGRAPH_TAG\n",
            "We are actively looking for vendors that are either industry leaders or partners and bringing them in and asking them what are your plans, your trends, getting them to present their thoughts and ideas and where the industry is going.\n",
            "[Director, Client Computing Division]\n",
            "In addition to external connections, because of the distinctive aspect of our investigation of IS-environmental absorptive capacity at an IS departmental, rather than organisational, level, internal connections with sustainability-oriented departments brought flows of sustainable IS knowledge.\n",
            "Internal connections refer to ties established to knowledge sources outside of the IS department but internal to EdInst, which in turn influence the development of IS-environmental absorptive capacity.\n",
            "Such exposure involves a two-way exchange of knowledge that is facilitated by building trust and structured engagement.\n",
            "In particular, the department turned to EdInst's Sustainability Committee and Property Services Department:\n",
            "I encourage the guys to go to the other departments within [EdInst]\n",
            "to find this knowledge, given you know, we've got leaders in this space.\n",
            "[Director, Infrastructure Division]\n",

            "[Director, Architecture Division] Third, in terms of sustainable IS triggers, participants reported that the Australian government prior to 2013 had a relatively stronger focus on climate change and signalled the importance of environmental sustainability with the introduction of environmental targets and a price on carbon emissions.\n",
            "This triggered the IS department to contribute to a reduction in the organisation's tax liability.\n",
            "However, with a change in government and the subsequent removal of the carbon price, the external motivation for developing IS-environmental absorptive capacity had declined.\n",

            "But when that pressure goes away there are so many other pressures on us from all local groups to do all these different things… [Director, Service Management Division]\n",
            "In addition, participants highlighted the potential role of international IT frameworks to influence the development of IS-environmental absorptive capacity.\n",
            "The CIO and directors of the Service Management and Applications Divisions suggested that if environmental sustainability were more explicitly embedded into frameworks such as Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) and Balanced Scorecard approaches, it can legitimise IS' leadership for sustainability.\n",

            "START_PARAGRAPH_TAG\n",
            "Thinking about ITIL and Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT), IT people love a good framework, so if you've got a good framework or process, they'll just embed it.\n",
            "So there is probably a way to embed some of this [environmental sustainability] without it having to be the leader setting this but just embed it into these frameworks that IT professionals just naturally gravitate towards anyway…\n",

            "IS-environmental absorptive capacity and its nomological net can be considered as an analytic and descriptive theory, as it provides 'a description of the phenomena of interest, analysis of relationships among those constructs, the degree of generalisability in constructs and relationships and the boundaries within which relationships and observations hold'.\n",

            "Although absorptive capacity is widely recognised in the management, IS and environmental sustainability literature, we believe that this is one of the few studies to develop the concept in a green IS context in an operationally meaningful way.\n",
            "While the higher-level processes of IS-environmental absorptive capacity are common, what is different is the type of knowledge that organisations need to learn and put to use, the mechanisms of doing so and the organisational and institutional antecedents that influence these processes.\n",
            "Further, as an organisation's amount of absorptive capacity may differ significantly from one domain to another, it is important to understand the nuances of absorptive capacity as it applies to specific domains.  START_CITE Pitt et al. (2011) END_CITE  CITE_b62  suggested that mainstream theories currently used in IS research are inadequate to understand the role of IS in the context of eco-sustainability, and researchers need to look into new theories that can cater to the age of sustainability.\n",

            "Roberts et al.'s (2012) review of the use of absorptive capacity in the IS literature identified 98 papers, of which many included absorptive capacity as only a minor citation (37 papers) or as theoretical support (43 papers).\n",
            "Fewer papers used absorptive capacity as part of their research model (13 papers) or theoretical base (5 papers), and only two departmental-level studies gave a detailed treatment of absorptive capacity.\n",
            "Our research therefore contributes much-needed understanding of absorptive capacity at an IS department level.\n",
            "We demonstrated that in using absorptive capacity at a departmental level, it would be necessary to make adaptations so that the concepts and constructs reflect the desired level of analysis.\n",
            "Notably, our identification of the importance of exposure to knowledge and gaining experience through connections and collaborations with partners outside of the IS department but internal to the organisation is valuable for understanding absorptive capacity at a departmental level, as is the identification of the IS department context and organisational sustainability context as moderators of sustainable IS exposure, prior experience and triggers.\n",
            "As there is a scarcity of IS studies that apply absorptive capacity theory at an IS departmental level  START_CITE (Roberts et al., 2012) END_CITE  CITE_b66 , our finding that information internal to the firm could also contribute to IS-environmental absorptive capacity is a useful contribution to research.\n",

            "Although qualitative studies are not subject to the same sampling requirements as quantitative research, care must be taken to ensure sufficient data are collected to ensure a theoretical saturation.\n",
            "We believe we have done so.\n",
            "As the two systems served specific activities, we were able to interview an important cross section of the relevant users and IT personnel.\n",

            "The emergent model is based on the experience of one city in managing water quality and green spaces.\n",
            "Although the examination of two systems allows for greater applicability, it still does not capture all the possible challenges and systems used by cities as they strive to become more sustainable.\n",
            "Nevertheless, this work breaks new ground in IS research as it is one of the first to specifically examine the role of IS in addressing the UN's ambitious agenda for global transformation as embodied within the SDGs.\n",

            "Our work was guided by two questions.\n",
            "In response to the first research question, we found that exiting IS provide benefits such as improved efficiency, compliance, information management and robust transactional platforms that support cities in their efforts to be more sustainable.\n",
            "However, these benefits largely address challenges faced in the administrative sphere and not those of the political and sustainability spheres.\n",
            "Building smart sustainable cities requires coordinated and integrated activities across these three spheres of engagement.\n",
            "Therefore, in response to the second research question, we propose that in order to advance progress toward the attainment of the SDGs by 2030, cities need to develop and implement a new type of IS, an IIE, that supports a holistic and multidisciplinary approach to sustainable development across all three spheres as described in the conceptual model.\n",

            "From these insights, the paper develops an empirically grounded theory explaining the role of an IIE in the building of sustainable cities.\n",
            "As such, our work responds to calls both for green IS research in the context of cities  START_CITE (Brauer et al., 2015) END_CITE  CITE_b3  and deeper theoretical reflection regarding IS solutions for sustainability more generally  START_CITE (Elliot, 2011) END_CITE  CITE_b25 .\n",
            "Our study reveals the application of IS in the administrative sphere is only one part of a comprehensive approach to advancing environmental sustainability.\n",
            "An IIE is needed to integrate interactions between the administrative, political and sustainability spheres of engagement.\n",
            "Through our definition of each of these spheres and the interactions between them, we provide greater clarity into the dynamic environment surrounding smart sustainable cities.\n",
            "The model overall provides a robust conceptual foundation for understanding how IS can contribute to the SDGs by demonstrating how IS must operate in an integrated fashion across the three spheres to permit a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary approach to managing city operations and policy-making.\n",

            "The second major contribution of this work is its contribution to practice, specifically for those with responsibility for designing, developing and implementing IS within cities.\n",
            "Not only does the emergent model provide novel insights around the dynamics between IS and the three spheres of engagement, but the illustration of the model using two real-world examples also demonstrates more practically the role of an IIE in smart sustainable cities today and in the future.\n",
            "Further, based on the model, we are able to identify practical implications and offer actionable suggestions for city managers and IT practitioners.\n",
